# Repair Crew
## _Frozen Rock Studios_

What is _Repair Crew_? It is a comical, task-based, multiplayer horror game similar to _Lethal Company_ and _Among Us_. Technicians will be tasked with repairing several substations in a derelict, procedurally generated facility. The Technicians will not be alone, however. Alien creatures, murderous robots, and eldritch horrors will stalk the Technicians to ensure the station does not become operational. Quick thinking and strategic planning will be required to ensure the facility is ready for processing by CORPORATEâ€™s Asset Reacquisition Team.
